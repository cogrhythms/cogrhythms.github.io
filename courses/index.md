# Courses

## BU MA665: Introduction to Modeling and Data Analysis in Neuroscience. (Kramer)
2-credit course for intro neurosci students.  Topics include:  basic spike train analysis, basic computational models of spiking, the Hodgkin-Huxley model of spiking, an introduction to Fourier series, and an introduction to networks.  Meets twice a week, with one lecture and one computer lab.
    
## BU MA666: Advanced Modeling and Data Analysis in Neuroscience. (Kramer)
2-credit course for more mathematically advanced neurosci students. Topics include introductions to:  correlation and coherence analysis, cross frequency coupling, and bifurcations in model neurons.  Meets twice a week, with one lecture and one computer lab.

## BU MA 568 Statistical Analysis of Point Process Data. (Eden)
Introduces the theory of point processes and develops practical problem-solving skills to construct models, assess goodness-of-fit, and perform estimation from point process data. 

## HST.576 Topics in Neural Signal Processing (Brown)
Focuses on signal processing methods for the analysis of stochastic dynamical systems in neuroscience.  Includes state-space methods and dynamic Baysian methods applied to continuous and point process observations. 

## HST.460 Statistics for Neuroscience Research, (Brown)
A survey of statistical methods for neuroscience research. Core topics include introductions to the theory of point processes, the generalized linear model, Monte Carlo methods, Bayesian methods, multivariate methods, time-series analysis, spectral analysis and state-space modeling. This course was developed jointly with Eden and a version is being planned for BU.  (Eden)

## HST.563 Imaging Biophysics and Applications (S. Stufflebeam, D. Boas)
Introduction to the connections and distinctions among various imaging modalities (ultrasound, MRI, EEG, optical), common goals of biomedical imaging, broadly defined target of biomedical imaging, and the current practical and economic landscape of biomedical imaging research. 

## MIT- MAS.881/20.452/9.422, (Boyden),  Principles of Neuroengineering
Tools and methods for analyzing brain dynamics, which was attended by undergraduate and graduate students throughout the CRC network.

## MIT- MAS.883/9.455/20.454/15.128/HST.588 (Boyden) Neurotechnology Ventures
Special seminar on how to get neuroengineering innovations
out into the world.

## Tufts Math 150 (Borgers)  Mathematical Neuroscience
Introduction to modeling neurons and
neuronal networks using differential equations. Hodgkin-Huxley equations; phase
plane analysis and bifurcation theory applied to neuronal models; reduced
models (integrate-and-fire neurons, theta neurons); modeling chemical and
electrical synapses; synchronization, rhythms, and waves in neuronal networks.
